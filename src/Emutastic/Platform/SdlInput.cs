    ///
    ///   1. A port whose console+player config carries a <c>ControllerDeviceId</c> reads THAT
    ///      device. If it is not attached the port reads nothing — it is deliberately not handed
    ///      some other pad, because silently giving player 1 player 2's controller is the exact
    ///      confusion an explicit binding exists to remove.
    ///   2. An unbound port keeps the device it already has for as long as that device is attached
    ///      and no binding claims it.
    ///   3. An unbound port with no device takes the next unclaimed device in SDL enumeration order.
    ///
    /// Rule 2 is what makes couch play survive a disconnect: previously <c>_pads[port]</c> was a
    /// plain list, so when player 1's pad dropped out every later player shifted down a slot
    /// mid-game. Now a disconnect frees only the port that owned the departed pad.
